# get-all-text-on-web-page

works on chrome

not working well on firefox; copying always fails with `document.execCommand(‘cut’/‘copy’) was denied because it was not called from inside a short running user-generated event handler.`; any other bookmarklet sometimes fails with `Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline (“script-src”).`
